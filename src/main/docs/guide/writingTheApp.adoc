As mentioned previously in this guide you are going to implement Neo4j https://neo4j.com/developer/example-project/[Movies example application]. The Neo4j website describes the example as follows:

[quote, Neo4j.com]
It is a simple, one-page webapp, that uses Neo4j’s movie demo database (movie, actor, director) as data set. The same front-end web page in all applications consumes 3 REST endpoints provided by backend implemented in the different programming languages and drivers.

The REST endpoints to be implemented are:

* single movie listing by title
* movie search by title
* graph visualization of the domain
